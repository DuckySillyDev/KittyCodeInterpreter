# KittyCodeInterpreter
 The most janky broken programming language made by a idiot in his bedroom
 
# **IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT. VERY UNSTABLE**

# Usage
 No real installer yet. You just need to run the interpreter in /src/interpreter/main.js
 Example:
 ```
 cd /src/interpreter/
 npm i
 node main --file testing.kitty --libarys ./testinglibs/
 ```

 # Docs
  this is all your getting
  ```
  // importing not added yet but it will be like this probally maybe
  import('packagethingy')

  log('meow')
  // comment
  // another useless command explaining nothing
  ```
  
  #### to be honest i dont know if this even counts as a programming language
